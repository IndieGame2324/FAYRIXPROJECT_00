# 5. Preliminary Operational Concept Of Proposed System

## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept of proposed system
The updated Fayrix Website will include an accessibility tool for the user to adjust the color of the website. Allowing color blind users to view the website with no problem. As well include text to speech tool for the visual impaired users and adjust the size of text. Many other options include saturation, cursor, text spacing, and many more to make the website usable for others. 
### a) operational policies and constraints;
To create an accessible website for all users, including those with disabilities the website should adhere to accessiblity standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. And provide alternative text for images, videos, etc. To ensure that users with visual impairments are able to understand the content. As well ensure that the website is fully keyboard accessible for those with physical disabilities, are able to navigate without a mouse. Of course, use color contrast that is readable by all users.
### b) description of the proposed system;
The proposed system or website will contain a visable accessibility toolbox that contains all the features said for all users, including those with disabilities to be able to interact with the website. The toolbox will be kept simple and visable on it's location. As well clear and precise on each individual feature. 
### c) modes of system operation;
The system will be made to be functional on a web browser and on mobile web browser. 
### d) user classes and other involved personnel; and
The invovled users will be the admin, manager, and the user/client. The admin will have access to the source code for the developement of the website. As well to the database, reports, and many more. The manager will be there for business purposes and will have the ability to see how the users interact with the toolbox. And recieve feeback from the users and report to the admin of possible changes. The user/client will have access to the accessibility toolbox which will include features for users with visual, physical, and hearing impairment. As well other features like text font to make the website more interactable and easier to understand. The user is able to report a feedback within the toolbox. 
### e) support environment.
The support environment is ideally made for website and mobile browers for potential clients wanting to get a service or look around the website. But a potential app can possible made in the future for easier booking of service. 
## 5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios
  1. Finding the accessiblity toolbox: The user lands on the website. From there on the bottom left will be a uniqe image to represent the accessibility toolbox. It will always be visable even when scrolling through the website. Which will be done by the admin and when the toolbox is clicked, it will open a list with all of the features that the client can used based of their needs. 
  2. The features in the toolbox: The toolbox will contain options for those with visual, physical, and hearing impairments. As well other features to make the website more accessable or readable. Within each features the admin will add options to adjust to the clients needs. Such as a scroll bar for color adjustment, audio level, and many more. If the client is unsatisfied then they can report a feedback within the toolbox. From there the manager will read the feedback and report to the admin for some changes. 
  3. Closing of the toolbox: The user can easily switch within the features by disabling or enabling the ones that aid them. To close all the features they can easily click on the exit button on the toolbox interface. In additon, it will reset the website to it's original settings but the user can enable the features again through the toolbox. 
# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
The system solution will be aqcuired via weekly meeting with the stakeholders. The weekly meeting will have disussion of what the client needs and what takes priority. The stakeholder and developers will discuss about the features and deliverable prototypes at set time intervals. The prototype will be tested for it's features and is a great to display the progress overall. And requirement checks at regular time interval as well. The production and verification will be tested through elicitation forms and unit testing of the system. The feedbacks will be important on the functionality of the system and needs by the client and stakeholder. 
## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept
The system will be deployed online for the business to test the functionality of the toolbox. Within existing business network they will get early access on the production of the new website. As for the client, it will be a web browser website on both mobile and computer. Then later on a mobile application is possible if clients demands.  
## 6.3 Preliminary support concept
In the early stages there will be a feedback option in the toolbox for clients to report on bugs, request, and others. As well regular maintanence, bug fixes, and solutions for problems in post launch. 
## 6.4 Preliminary retirement concept
The user/clients will be notified about a year before the retirement of the toolbox. Then either replaced with an updated version or a new system that is superior to the toolbox. With features that support new technology devices. 
# 7. Project Constraints
The constraints of the project will be cost and features. The reason behind cost is for regular maintainence and the addition of features. Due to users may want features that satisfies once needs or more control over a certain feature. To keep the cost low it will be best to have simple features that satisfies the user needs. It's best for the client to interact at basic levels and be happy. Then later on we can add more options to each individual features. As for scheduling, we would deploy the feature that is used the most and from there add on. Till the toolbox satisfies the stakeholders and clients and is deployed.
